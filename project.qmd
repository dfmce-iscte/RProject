## Project Overview

In this data analysis project, students will delve into the ridership data of Île-de-France's railway stations spanning the years 2017 to 2022. The primary objective is to analyze and visualize the ridership patterns, creating a dashboard that allows stakeholders to monitor and compare ridership against the norm. The analysis will specifically focus on discerning variations from a typical week, distinguishing between regular weeks and holiday periods.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Data Collection and Cleaning

- The data that you will use for this study are available trought  the STIF open data portal :
    - [validation per day and stop point first semester of 2023](https://data.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/explore/dataset/validations-reseau-ferre-nombre-validations-par-jour-1er-semestre/information/)
    - [validation per day and stop point 2015 - 2022](https://data.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/explore/dataset/histo-validations-reseau-ferre/information/)
    - [stops i.e "Zone d'arrêt" locations](https://data.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/explore/dataset/zones-d-arrets/information/?disjunctive.zdatype)
    - other ressources from stif open data website
- Gather and compile ridership data from Île-de-France railway stations for the specified period, starting from  from 2017-07-01.


- Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
- Aggregate the dataset at the "Zone d'arrêt" level defined by the ID_REFA_LDA feature, collect geographical data about their localisiations 

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conduct exploratory analysis to identify overall trends and patterns in ridership.
- Explore seasonality, monthly trends, and potential outliers affecting the data.


### 4. Comparison with Norms

- Define a baseline "normal" week and investigate deviations during holiday and non-holiday periods.
- Assess the impact of vacations and school breaks on ridership patterns.

### 5. Dashboard Development using Shiny

- Build an interactive dashboard using the Shiny framework in R.
- Include key visualizations depicting overall ridership trends, weekly variations, and comparisons with the norm.

Example of tools :

- Allow the user to select a reference period and a period to compare against and provide meaningfull figures to highlight the differences between the two selected periods, discriminating by day of week.
- Allow the user to quickly select a stations of interest with a webnmap and procides key statistics about the current trend for this stations.

### 6. Statistical Methods

- Apply appropriate simple statistical methods to validate findings and draw meaningful insights from the data.
- Use statistical tests to assess the significance of observed variations, when possible.

### 7. Report and Documentation

- Produce a comprehensive report detailing the entire analysis process, methodologies used, and key findings.
- Include insights into how the railway network's ridership has evolved over the studied period.

### 8. Shiny App Deployment

- Deploy the Shiny dashboard on shinyapp.io for accessibility and user interaction.
- Ensure the application is user-friendly and capable of providing dynamic insights into ridership patterns.

## Deliverables

- A well-documented report in quarto format including code, analysis, and interpretations.
- A functional Shiny dashboard accessible through shinyapp.io.
